# unix-shell

## Introduction

This is just a collection of various shell tools and environment & application configs that I have generated over the years. There might not be much in this repo, just yet. As I update a file, I am going to go through and sanitize (and maybe refactor) it and then will then publish it here for public consumption.

## License

There is no overall license for this repo. The license for anye one file should be inherited from whatever the application or interpreter of the file is. The .bashrc file's license, for example, is the same license as that of the Bourne Again Shell (GNU GPL 3+).

## Disclaimer

These are files that just evolved organically over decades of working in various Unix-like environments. You might find some of my implementations dated or downright confusing. This is fine. You can improve upon my implementations, if you like. Some of my implementations are the way they are because they had to work with SunOS (BSD), OpenBSD, Solaris (SysV-based) and Linux, and others are the way they are because they were only ever used on one flavor. Make use of what you can and please do not pester me to fix/improve them. You can send me a pull request if you have improved upoon them yourself, but don't expect me to act on it in a timely manner.

## Pull Requests

I'll accept pull requests, but they have to be branched. There's no formality around the development of this repo, due to the nature of it, I just don't want to have master clobbered by an incompatible change. I don't currently depend on this repo, but I may -- in the future -- decide to use to populate a new homedir on another host somewhere out there.
